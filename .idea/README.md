# Web Assessment: Colmar Academy

This is my solution to the Java Assessment. The assessment requires build a Java-based Student and Student Service features.

### The challenge
Write the methods that complete the program.
Test the program to verify if it works properly.
Prepare the program to handle wrong data format insertion.

[Part 1] Understanding the StudentGen project

[Part 2] Implementing the Student and StudentService missing features

### How to run it
git clone https://github.com/ImGareth83/StudentGen.git

ideally, it should be open in IntelliJ and execute directly from there.

Otherwise, execute using the java command from the command line

java com.generation.java.Main 

### Built with
